🟢 Easy (Warm-up / Fundamentals)


1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
Compute cumulative sums.
Key idea: simple prefix sum construction.


1732. Find the Highest Altitude
Max of cumulative gains.
Key idea: running prefix of net gain.


724. Find Pivot Index
Left sum == right sum.
Key idea: total sum and running left sum (or prefix + suffix arrays).


1991. Find the Middle Index in Array
Pivot index variant.
Key idea: same as 724.


1422. Maximum Score After Splitting a String
Best split into zeros-left + ones-right.
Key idea: prefix counts of ‘0’, suffix counts of ‘1’.


303. Range Sum Query – Immutable
Fast range sum queries.
Key idea: prefix sum array to answer sum(l..r) in O(1).


121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (can be seen via cumulative min; not classic prefix sum, but adjacent)
Key idea: track min prefix and max profit.



🟠 Medium (Core Prefix Sum Techniques)


560. Subarray Sum Equals K
Count subarrays whose sum = k.
Key idea: prefix sum + hashmap of frequencies.


930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
Count subarrays with sum = s in binary array.
Key idea: identical to 560 with binary optimization.


523. Continuous Subarray Sum
Subarray sum is multiple of k.
Key idea: prefix sum modulo k + earliest index map.


525. Contiguous Array
Longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s.
Key idea: transform 0→-1; longest subarray with sum=0 (prefix hashmap first index).


238. Product of Array Except Self
Output product except self without division.
Key idea: prefix products + suffix products (classic).


1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum
Count subarrays with odd total.
Key idea: prefix parity counts (#even, #odd).


1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval
Work hours > 8 vs ≤ 8.
Key idea: transform to +1/-1; longest subarray with positive sum using prefix + monotonic stack / earliest index map.


304. Range Sum Query 2D – Immutable
2D prefix sums for rectangular queries.
Key idea: 2D prefix matrix to compute any rectangle sum in O(1).


1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays
Exactly k odd numbers in subarray.
Key idea: prefix count of odds + hashmap of frequencies.


1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
Pick from ends; minimize picks.
Key idea: convert to longest subarray with sum = total - x (prefix + hashmap or two-pointer for non-negative).


1871. Jump Game VII (can be done via prefix of reachability windows)
Key idea: prefix of reachable counts to speed sliding window checks.



🔴 Hard (Advanced Prefix/Suffix / Trickier Use-Cases)


689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays
Pick 3 windows of size k to maximize sum.
Key idea: prefix sums + DP on left/best and right/best arrays.


1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target
Count matrices with target sum.
Key idea: fix top/bottom rows → collapse to 1D; use prefix-hash (like 560) per column span.


1749. Maximum Absolute Sum of Any Subarray
Max |sum| over all subarrays.
Key idea: track min/max prefix sums; or Kadane variants for max/min.


1125. Smallest Sufficient Team (not prefix sum, but sometimes combined with prefix-like coverage ideas; listed for breadth)
If you prefer strictly prefix/suffix-related, you can skip this.


2381. Shifting Letters II (difference-array / prefix application)
Apply many range shifts efficiently.
Key idea: difference array + prefix accumulation.


2213. Longest Substring of One Repeating Character (with updates)
Data-structure heavy; can use difference arrays and prefix structures for batch ops.
(Advanced; optional.)
